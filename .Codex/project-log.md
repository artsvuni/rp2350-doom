### 22:23 — Add floating swipe-and-hold movement

- Researched floating joysticks, anywhere-on-screen gestures, dead zones, and axial bias.
- Preserved and documented the original four fixed hold zones behind a compile-time selector.
- Implemented touch-anywhere anchoring, 24px dead zone, direction hold/change, and release-to-stop.
- Commit: included in this control-experiment commit.

### 22:20 — Stabilize touch, display memory, and Doom zone

- Debounced touch-zone transitions and removed blocking per-touch AMOLED diagnostics.
- Replaced the 128KB rotated presentation buffer with a 35KB tiled 448x280 scaler/transposer.
- Cleared the previously uninitialized letterbox bands and expanded the short-pointer zone by 64KB.
- Firmware builds and boots; extended gameplay lasts substantially longer, with memory stability still under test.
- Commit: included in this milestone commit.
